there is real product and liability risk if HailyDB’s API (and your UI) label an NWS Wind Advisory as “Radar‑detected 60 mph wind” in a way that looks like an official, observed product, when in fact:
The CAP text only says “isolated gusts to 60 mph are possible” (a forecast-style advisory), and
The radar_indicated value is a HailyDB enrichment, not an NWS field.
If downstream apps (like IDOLCheck, insurers, law firms, etc.) present that label to end users or in documentation, it can easily be interpreted as “NWS/radar confirmed 60 mph wind at the surface here”, which is stronger than what NWS actually wrote. That misalignment is exactly the kind of thing you’d want to de‑risk now.
I’m not a lawyer and this isn’t legal advice, but from a product/risk perspective you should treat this as something to fix, not just a cosmetic nit.
What I would recommend to HailyDB
Immediately change labeling semantics (forward‑looking):
For NWS‑sourced alerts, primary label = event (e.g. “Wind Advisory”).
Any HailyDB field like hailydb_enrichments.radar_indicated.wind_mph should be surfaced as:
“HailyDB radar‑derived estimate: 60 mph potential”
not “Radar‑detected 60 mph wind”.
Badges like “Radar‑indicated” in clients should either:
be renamed to “Radar‑derived” / “Estimated”, or
be shown only when the source is a dedicated radar product (not a generic CAP advisory).
Document clearly in the HailyDB API contract:
Fields under hailydb_enrichments are derived analytics, not official NWS/SPC observations.
Consumers must not relabel NWS products based solely on enrichment; they should always pair event type + original description with any derived metrics.
Audit where “Radar‑detected / Radar‑indicated” appears:
In HailyDB’s own UI.
In example client code / SDKs.
In partner apps (like IDOLCheck) that already rely on radar_indicated.
Talk to counsel once you’ve scoped the change:
