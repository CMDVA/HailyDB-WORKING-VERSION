Add /api/radar-alerts/summary endpoint for front-end dashboards

Purpose: Allow client applications (IDOLCheck and others) to quickly query city+date heatmap summaries of radar-detected hail and wind events.

Requirements:

1️⃣ Endpoint:
GET /api/radar-alerts/summary

2️⃣ Query Parameters:

start_date (required, format YYYY-MM-DD)

end_date (required, format YYYY-MM-DD)

state (optional, 2-letter state code, e.g. "FL")

min_hail_inches (optional, float, default = 0) → only count hail events ≥ this size

min_wind_mph (optional, int, default = 50) → only count wind events ≥ this speed

city (optional, string, partial match, to filter one city if desired)

3️⃣ Query Logic:

Group radar_alerts table by:

city

state

date (extract from detected_time timestamp)

For each (city, state, date), return:

hail_count: count of distinct hail events ≥ min_hail_inches

max_hail_inches: largest hail_inches value detected that day for that city

wind_count: count of distinct wind events ≥ min_wind_mph

max_wind_mph: largest wind_mph value detected that day for that city

4️⃣ Response Format:

  "summary": [
    {
      "city": "Tampa",
      "state": "FL",
      "date": "2025-06-10",
      "hail_count": 3,
      "max_hail_inches": 1.25,
      "wind_count": 1,
      "max_wind_mph": 60
    },
    {
      "city": "Orlando",
      "state": "FL",
      "date": "2025-06-09",
      "hail_count": 0,
      "wind_count": 2,
      "max_wind_mph": 70
    },
    ...
  ]
}
5️⃣ Performance Considerations:

Implement with indexed query → use existing indexes on detected_time, hail_inches, wind_mph, city, state

Make sure query is efficient for 30-day spans across large states

6️⃣ Test Cases to Validate:

Summary for FL for last 10 days

Summary for entire US for 7-day span

Summary for 1 city across 30 days → verify city filter works

Summary with high min_hail_inches (e.g. ≥1.5) → filters correctly

Summary with high min_wind_mph (e.g. ≥80) → filters correctly

7️⃣ Deployment Steps:

Add /api/radar-alerts/summary route to main.py

Add to API documentation (api/radar-alerts section)

Test in Postman and verify output matches radar_alerts table data

Important:
This endpoint is read-only, pure summary → no writes. Must be safe for heavy front-end use (IDOLCheck dashboards and mobile clients).
