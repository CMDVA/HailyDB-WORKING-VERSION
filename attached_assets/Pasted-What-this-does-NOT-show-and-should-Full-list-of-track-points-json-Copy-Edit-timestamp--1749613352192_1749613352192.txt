What this does NOT show (and should):
✅ Full list of track points:

json
Copy
Edit
[
  { "timestamp": ..., "lat": ..., "lon": ..., "wind_mph": ..., "pressure_mb": ..., "status": ... },
  ...
]
✅ Closest approach to U.S. land

✅ County FIPS codes affected (derived geometry intersection → you want this badly for insurance)

✅ Rainfall totals (if available in source — some HURDAT2 enriched datasets include this)

✅ Wind radii (quadrant-based — in good datasets you can get 34kt/50kt/64kt wind radii in each quadrant — valuable for estimating which counties were in damaging wind fields)

✅ Landfall metadata:

Edit
{
  "location": "...",
  "timestamp": "...",
  "category": "...",
  "wind_mph": ...
}
✅ Flags for TS vs Cat1 vs Cat2+ impacting land

Why this matters:
👉 Just telling IDOLCheck "this storm happened" with a name + dates + 2 points is nearly worthless for claim targeting.

👉 What you want:

1️⃣ Per-county affected FIPS mapping
→ Ties into IDOLCheck’s ZIP/FIPS filtering for prospect targeting

2️⃣ Per-timestamp wind field data
→ Which areas saw hurricane-force vs TS-force winds

3️⃣ Landfall metadata
→ Critical — adjusters LOVE "landfall at X mph in county Y"

4️⃣ Track visualization
→ Simple endpoint to return full track points → needed for map display in web apps

5️⃣ Impact scoring per county
→ You can build a simple impact score per county:
- Proximity to track center
- Max wind recorded
- In quadrant with 50kt+ winds
- Landfall or not
→ This can feed a "probability of damage" heuristic for marketing / claim work.

Conclusion:
You are not ingesting enough useful hurricane track data yet.
That output proves your ingestion is thin → track_points=2 is a red flag.
No per-county mapping means the data is not actionable for contractors or adjusters.

Recommendation:
✅ Fix hurricane ingest to fully parse all track points per storm

✅ Compute:

Closest approach per county

Affected counties list per storm

Landfall metadata

Store wind radii per timestamp if available

Provide /api/hurricane-tracks/{storm_id}/track endpoint that returns full track points for map display

✅ Add:

/api/hurricane-tracks/affected-counties?storm_id=...
→ Returns list of FIPS with impact scoring
