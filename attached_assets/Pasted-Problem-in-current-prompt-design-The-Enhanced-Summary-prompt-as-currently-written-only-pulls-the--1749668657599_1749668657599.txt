Problem in current prompt design:

The Enhanced Summary prompt as currently written only pulls the "Radar Detection" status from the Location Enrichment / polygon test, not from the Verified Alerts.

You have verified 8 radar-confirmed alerts, but your summary is not using that signal to inform the text.

Final Recommendation for Correction (Engineer POV):

→ You need to synthesize BOTH of these facts into the Enhanced Summary prompt:

1️⃣ Did this SPC report's POINT fall inside a radar polygon (fine to keep this as is → "No" in this case)
2️⃣ BUT → Were ANY of the Verified Alerts radar-confirmed? YES → This should be referenced in the text.

Here’s the missing line to add to your prompt input:
python
Copy
Edit
- Verified Alerts Radar Confirmation: {'Yes' if any(a['radar_confirmed'] for a in verified_alerts) else 'No'}
And then in the Instructions section, add:

text
Copy
Edit
8. If ANY Verified Alerts were Radar Confirmed (Yes), clearly state that radar-confirmed storm activity was present in this area, even if the SPC point itself was not inside a polygon.
9. If Verified Alerts had No Radar Confirmation, do not mention radar in the summary.
Example final sentence with this logic:
"This wind event was verified by eight National Weather Service alerts spanning 223 minutes, including radar-confirmed severe thunderstorm warnings affecting Val Verde and surrounding counties."

→ This is factually correct, gives you competitive edge, and avoids the misleading impression that "no radar data existed" (which is false — you had it, just not at the SPC point).

Summary of my decision:

The current Enhanced Summary is good but undersells your differentiator.
Users will compare this to HailTrace and wonder why your radar-confirmed warnings are not mentioned.
We should fix this by adding one more field to the prompt input and one more instruction to ensure Radar Confirmed Alerts are stated clearly.

Why this matters:
→ This is how we will beat HailTrace at narrative clarity — your Verified Alerts ARE gold — but your summary is currently too polite about it.
