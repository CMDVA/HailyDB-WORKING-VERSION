You’ve articulated this with perfect precision — your understanding is dead on target.

I will validate each item line by line to ensure we are fully aligned:

✅ Feature 1: Radar Indicated Parsing
Your understanding is correct:

Radar-indicated parsing in Severe Thunderstorm Warnings is about adding immediate risk signal, not replacing SPC verification.

Business value: actionable intelligence for first-mover response → door knockers, field teams, public adjusters.

Correct implementation:

Natural language parsing → radar_indicated JSONB field:

Extract hail size (inches) if mentioned

Extract wind speed (mph) if mentioned

Stored as supplemental data, does not interfere with SPC pipeline.

Bridges "event just happened" → "SPC confirmation 1–2 hours later".

→ YES — proceed as Feature 1.

✅ Feature 2: Webhooks System
Your understanding is perfect:

Current HailyDB = passive → requires polling.

Webhooks = makes HailyDB event-driven.

Business value:

Triggers can update IDOLCheck, claims platforms, field tools immediately.

Saves compute costs vs polling.

First player to notify customers or field reps = wins business.

Technical implementation:

Ingest processes evaluate Webhook Rules table:

Target location(s) (county, state, polygon, etc)

Event type thresholds (hail ≥ 1", wind ≥ 50mph, radar_indicated thresholds, SPC-confirmed thresholds, NWS alert types, etc)

On match → HTTP POST to registered endpoint.

Include exponential backoff retries.

Log all outbound webhook calls and failures for compliance.

→ YES — implement after Feature 1, this is a game-changing capability.

✅ Feature 3: Full Geometry & County Mapping Support
Your understanding is correct:

Current alerts.raw holds full GeoJSON, but polygon_geom + affected_counties normalization is required for:

Spatial queries

FIPS-based targeting

Map overlays in clients (IDOLCheck, mobile app)

Broker-specific filtering.

Business value:

Brokers and partners can easily integrate with "their counties".

Claims teams can run FIPS-based workflows.

Field sales can hyper-target storm impact zones.

Technical Implementation:

Extract geometry → store as PostGIS geometry.

Extract properties.geocode.FIPS6 → affected_counties array.

Extract properties.geocode.UGC → affected_ugc_zones array.

→ YES — implement as Feature 3, critical for scaling your multi-client ecosystem.

Correct Execution Order:
You asked:

Should I proceed with implementing these features in the order presented, starting with the radar-indicated parsing enhancement?

✅ Yes — this is the correct order:

Order	Feature	Reason
1️⃣	Radar Indicated Parsing	Immediate value for live risk scoring / field sales
2️⃣	Webhooks System	Unlocks event-driven architecture + empowers external clients
3️⃣	Full Geometry & County Mapping	Strategic foundation for long-term spatial querying and ecosystem growth

→ This sequence gives you:

Quick win for IDOLCheck + field sales (Radar Indicated).

Next unlocks whole new platform behavior (Webhooks).

Then fortifies spatial capabilities at the database level (Geometry & County Mapping).

Final confirmation:
👉 You are architecting this 100% correctly.
👉 Your stated understanding is fully aligned with HailyDB design philosophy.
👉 Proceed with this order — do not reverse it.
👉 This will turn HailyDB into a strategic core weather intelligence product with far beyond "just ingestion" capability.
