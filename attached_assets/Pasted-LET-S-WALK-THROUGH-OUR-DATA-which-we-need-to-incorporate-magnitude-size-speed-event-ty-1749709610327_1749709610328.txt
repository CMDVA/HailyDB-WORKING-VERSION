LET'S WALK THROUGH OUR DATA which we need to incorporate.....

- magnitude (size / speed)
- event type (hail / wind)
- time, date (can be converted to local time)
- Location
- county 
- state
- event location
- nearest major city
- other nearby places (up to 3)
- hail size scale
- wind speed scale

We're also not applying our hail size natural language equivalents:      # Extract hail size - NWS descriptive sizes
            hail_size_map = {
                'pea': 0.25, 'peanut': 0.5, 'penny': 0.75,
                'nickel': 0.88, 'quarter': 1.0, 'half dollar': 1.25,
                'ping pong ball': 1.5, 'golf ball': 1.75, 'egg': 2.0,
                'tennis ball': 2.5, 'baseball': 2.75, 'large apple': 3.0,
                'softball': 4.0, 'grapefruit': 4.5
            }

1.5" hail was reported 1.4 miles south of near Plum Tree Reservoir (1.4mi) (10 NNE Recluse), or approximately 1.4 miles south from Plum Tree Reservoir, in Campbell County, WY at 23:52 (UTC) on unknown date. Large Hail - Reported Damage: (UNR). Other nearby locations include Gillette (40.4mi) (40.4 mi), Chalk Prong (1.7mi) (1.7 mi). (UNR)

Errors
- "miles south of near"
- "or approximately [repeats same location reference instead of major city]"
- "unknown date (data breakdown, not passing to OpenAI
- Large hail = BECAUSE IT WAS 1" ACCORDING TO OUR HAIL MAPPING
- Other nearby locations = NOT using actual nearby places data; OR sorting closest to furthest, closest 3

To wrap up- THIS IS THE OFFICIAL TABLE FROM NWS REGARDING HAIL SIZE / DAMAGE AND WIND SPEED / DAMAGE

HAIL via NWS:
Note: To be considered severe, hail stones must be at least 1 inch in diameter.
Small Hail - Hail less than 1 inch in diameter (from the size of peas to nickels).
Large Hail - Hail from 1 inch to 1 3/4 inch in diameter (from the size of quarters to golf balls) causing minor damage. 
Very Large Hail  - Hail from 1 3/4 inch to 2 3/4 inch in diameter (from the size of golf balls to baseballs) causing moderate damage. 
Giant Hail - Hail larger than 2 3/4 inch (larger than baseballs, such as the size of grapefruit or softballs) causing major damage. 

WIND via NWS: 
Note: To be considered severe, associated wind gusts must be 58 mph or greater (50 knots or greater).
Strong Wind Gusts - Thunderstorm wind gusts between 39 mph and 57 mph (between 34 knots and 49 knots).

Damaging Wind Gusts - Severe thunderstorm wind gusts between 58 mph and 74 mph (between 50 knots and 64 knots) causing minor damage. 
Very Damaging Wind Gusts  -  Severe thunderstorm wind gusts between 75 mph and 91 mph (between 65 knots and 79 knots) causing moderate damage. 
Violent Wind Gusts -  Severe thunderstorm wind gusts greater than 92 mph (80 knots or greater) causing major damage.
