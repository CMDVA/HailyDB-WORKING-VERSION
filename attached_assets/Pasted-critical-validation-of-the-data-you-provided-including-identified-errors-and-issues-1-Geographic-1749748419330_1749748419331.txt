critical validation of the data you provided, including identified errors and issues:

1. Geographic Error
Nearby Location Issue:

json
Copy
Edit
{"distance_miles":880.8,"name":"Denver","type":"nearest_city"}
Problem: Denver is not a "nearby city" to George West, TX — they are over 800 miles apart, and Denver is not relevant in this local weather report.

Conclusion: Likely an enrichment or lookup error in your nearby_locations generation. Denver should be removed — it is misleading.

2. Inconsistent Distance Reporting
George West City Hall listed at 0.3mi — okay.

George West listed at 0.5mi — this is semantically redundant because the tornado is already reported in George West proper. You are double listing the core location as a "nearby_place."

Recommendation: You should deduplicate George West from nearby_locations if it's already the main location.name. Only list distinct landmarks.

3. Datetime Fields Are Incomplete
json
Copy
Edit
"datetime":{"display":null,"timestamp":null,"utc":null}
You say the event was at 12:39 UTC on June 12, 2025 in your enhanced_summary:

'f_scale': 'UNK' tornado was reported [...] at 12:39 (UTC) on June 12, 2025.

But your actual datetime object is null / missing data:

ERROR: datetime object should be populated with this known value.

Missing timestamp creates parsing issues in downstream processing.

Fix: Populate datetime.timestamp with 2025-06-12T12:39:00Z.

4. Inconsistent Location Reference
In enhanced_summary:

880.8 miles north-northeast of Denver (George West), in Live Oak County, TX

Contradiction / Bad Wording: Saying "880.8 miles north-northeast of Denver" but "in George West" is semantically nonsensical.

George West is not 880.8 miles north-northeast of Denver — it's south of Denver.

This is a badly constructed phrase — probably a templating bug.

Fix: Remove this phrase or reword entirely. Example:

"UNK tornado reported in George West, Live Oak County, TX at 12:39 UTC on June 12, 2025."

Do not attempt to calculate distance from a distant city unless contextually meaningful (e.g., metro reporting).

5. Missing Magnitude Fields
json
Copy
Edit
"magnitude":{"display":null,"raw":null,"unit":null,"value":null}
Tornadoes typically report EF-scale if known, or explicitly mark as UNK.

You already have 'f_scale': 'UNK' in the enhanced_summary but it's not mapped into your magnitude object.

Fix: Populate magnitude object:

json
Copy
Edit
"magnitude":{"display":"F-Scale: UNK","raw":null,"unit":"F-Scale","value":null}
Or explicitly mark it as "UNK" in value.
