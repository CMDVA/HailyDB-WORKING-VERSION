Update the _generate_nearby_places method in spc_enrichment.py with the following revised logic and priorities:

OBJECTIVE:
Enhance SPC Report Location Context using ONLY the SPC latitude and longitude. Do not rely on SPC-provided text (such as “8 miles NE of Ocala”).

EVENT LOCATION (Primary Location field):

The goal is to populate the "Event Location" field with the closest publicly identifiable, Google Maps-searchable place to the SPC lat/lon.

Prioritize accuracy and public recognizability.

PRIORITY ORDER:

1️⃣ Closest public place with a known name and address:
- Schools (K-12, colleges, universities)
- Hospitals, medical centers
- Fire stations
- Police stations
- Parks or public recreation areas
- Libraries
- Civic centers
- Named public buildings (city hall, post office, etc.)

2️⃣ If no public place within 5 miles → fallback to:
- Closest named small community, CDP (Census Designated Place), village, unincorporated place, township, etc.

3️⃣ If no such place within 5 miles → fallback to:
- "Rural area near [Nearest Named Place]"

NEAREST MAJOR CITY (Separate field — do NOT change current logic here):
Keep this as-is → provide the closest major city for regional context.

ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS:

✅ Always provide distance in miles from SPC lat/lon to Event Location
✅ Always provide approximate coordinates (lat/lon) of Event Location
✅ Return names that are Google Maps-searchable whenever possible
✅ Do not return land features (rivers, creeks, etc.) unless absolutely no other options
✅ Do not return counties or state names as Event Location → we want precise, local context

Prompt Adjustment:
Update the AI prompt inside _generate_nearby_places to reflect this exact logic.
Adjust your parsing logic if needed to handle this updated priority order and fallback structure.

Once this is done:

✅ "Event Location" field will be highly actionable for field teams and easily mappable.
✅ "Nearest Major City" will continue to provide anchor context.
✅ SPC-provided text will not influence the location enrichment.
