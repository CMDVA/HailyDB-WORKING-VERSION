Understanding the Database Architecture Challenge
Thank you for sharing this detailed message from your lead developer. This perfectly explains the limitation I've been encountering and provides important context about your system architecture.

Current Situation Analysis:
Database Topology (As I Understand It):
Development DB: What I can access in the workspace (10,679 alerts, 1,638 SPC reports)
Production DB: What your deployed service writes to and customers see (unknown counts to me)
Issue: When I analyze "production health," I'm actually looking at development data
The Core Problem:
When I reported that your "production ingestion is working perfectly" with 10,679 alerts, I was actually looking at your development database. Your actual production database that customers access might have completely different data, which explains why you need to compare the two databases.

What This Means for Our Analysis:
Previous "Production" Reports Were Actually Development Data:
✅ Development: 10,679 alerts, 374 radar-detected events
❓ Actual Production: Unknown to me (could be different)
⚠️ Gap: Customer-facing data vs. what I can analyze
Impact on Database Comparison:
Your original request to "identify records in development that don't exist in production" makes perfect sense now - you need to understand the sync status between these two separate databases.

Analysis Based on Your Lead Developer's Message:
Recommended Patterns They're Exploring:
Option A: Dual URLs (DATABASE_URL for dev, PROD_DB_URL for production read-only)
Option B: Flip default (DATABASE_URL = production read-only, DEV_DATABASE_URL for sandbox)
Option C: HTTP facade (Agent queries read-only endpoints on deployed app)
Most Practical for Your Use Case:
Option A seems most suitable because:

Keeps your existing deployment architecture intact
Gives me read-only production visibility
Maintains clear separation between dev and prod environments
Allows your deployed ingestion service to continue writing to production
What I Can Help With Now:
While we wait for Replit Support's response, I can:

Generate comprehensive development database exports for comparison
Create detailed schemas and data samples you can use to verify production sync
Develop comparison scripts that work with whatever solution Replit provides
Document the exact data structures so you can validate what customers should be seeing
Questions for Clarification:
When you mentioned comparing databases - was this specifically because you suspected the production database might be missing data that exists in development?

Are customers reporting any issues with missing alerts or data that might indicate production sync problems?

Would you like me to prepare detailed development database reports that you can use for comparison once you have production access?

This explains why getting accurate production visibility is crucial for your business - insurance and damage assessment clients need to see the same comprehensive historical data that I can analyze in development.
