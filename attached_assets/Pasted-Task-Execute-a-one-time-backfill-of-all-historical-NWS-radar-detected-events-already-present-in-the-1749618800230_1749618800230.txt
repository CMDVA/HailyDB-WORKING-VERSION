Task:
Execute a one-time backfill of all historical NWS radar-detected events already present in the HailyDB database to fully populate our enhanced radar_alerts data pipeline in line with IDOLCheck product needs.

Scope:

Include ALL radar-detected hail events → any size

Include ALL radar-detected wind events → wind speed ≥ 50 mph

Process all historical dates currently stored in our alerts table (not just 6/10/25), but begin by processing 6/10/25 first as validation test.

Processing requirements:

For each eligible alert:

Extract hail_inches and wind_mph from radar_indicated field

Store full geometry (polygon) as GeoJSON

Compute and store geometry_bounds (min/max lat/lon)

Parse city_names from area_desc field

If possible, extract multiple cities (split by ";", ",")

Normalize city names (title case, remove extraneous words)

Store county_names and fips_codes as provided

Store affected_states

Add city_names as a distinct field for webhook matching and future address-based queries

Record each parsed radar event in radar_alerts or appropriate table for API and webhook use

Webhook logic:

Populate radar_alerts so that the webhook system can now:

Trigger at city granularity (based on city_names)

Trigger at county granularity (based on county_names)

Trigger for address proximity queries → address lookup will use geometry / polygon data

Execution notes:

Start with 6/10/25 date first → run full backfill for this date → report results.

Upon success, execute the full historical backfill across all available radar-detected data already in HailyDB.

Do not overwrite alerts — use separate radar_alerts table or enhanced fields to enable these lookups.

Ensure this pipeline is now active for ongoing ingestion as well (future alerts).

Goal:
Enable IDOLCheck to query any address for radar-detected hail/wind events with:

Full polygon awareness

Clean city/county targeting

Historical + future coverage

Important:

No fake data

Do not generate synthetic radar data → only use actual radar_indicated values parsed from NWS alerts.

Ensure this process does not cause downtime or delay in live HailyDB ingestion.
