A faster drop in water levels in the basin along\nwith a rise on Mendenhall Lake will indicate a sub-glacier release\nand our office will issue a Flood Warning. From that point, the\noutburst flooding event would take about 48 hours to peak.\n\nNow is the time to finish up the flood preparation/planning and get\nthose plans \"SET\" so they can be put into action, and \"GO\" when a\nFlood Warning is issued.

It is OK to be active outdoors but take more breaks.\nWatch for symptoms such as coughing or shortness of breath.\n\nPeople with asthma: Follow your asthma action plan and keep quick\nrelief medicine handy.\n\nPeople with heart disease: Symptoms such as palpitations,\nshortness of breath, or unusual fatigue may indicate a serious\nproblem. If you have any of these, contact your health care\nprovider.\n\nAdditional Details:\nCanadian wildfire smoke will impact surface air quality as it\nmoves ENE across northern portions of the state through early\nTuesday afternoon. The heaviest smoke impacts are expected in far\nnorthwest Wisconsin, where PM2.5 NowCast AQI values of Unhealthy\n(Red) will be possible. Lesser impacts in the Moderate (Yellow) to\nUnhealthy for Sensitive Groups (Orange) AQI range are expected\nfurther south and east in the advisory area.\n\nA cold front moving in from the northwest on Tuesday morning will\nbegin to clear this initial round of smoke from northwest to\nsoutheast.

It is OK to be active outdoors but take more breaks.\nWatch for symptoms such as coughing or shortness of breath.\n\nPeople with asthma: Follow your asthma action plan and keep quick\nrelief medicine handy.\n\nPeople with heart disease: Symptoms such as palpitations,\nshortness of breath, or unusual fatigue may indicate a serious\nproblem. If you have any of these, contact your health care\nprovider.\n\nAdditional Details:\n\nCanadian wildfire smoke will impact surface air quality as it\nmoves ENE across northern portions of the state later Monday\nmorning through early Tuesday afternoon. The heaviest smoke\nimpacts are expected in far northwest Wisconsin, where\nPM2.5 NowCast AQI values of Unhealthy (Red) will be possible.\nLesser impacts in the Moderate (Yellow) to Unhealthy for\nSensitive Groups (Orange) AQI range are expected further south\nand east in the advisory area. A cold front moving in from the\nnorthwest on Tuesday morning will begin to clear this initial\nround of smoke from northwest to southeast. Although more smoke\ncould move in behind the front, we do not expect advisory\ncriteria to be met with the second round of smoke at this time.\n\nFor more information on current air quality, please see:\n\nhttps://airquality.wi.gov",

It is OK to be active outdoors but take more breaks.\nWatch for symptoms such as coughing or shortness of breath.\n\nPeople with asthma: Follow your asthma action plan and keep quick\nrelief medicine handy.\n\nPeople with heart disease: Symptoms such as palpitations,\nshortness of breath, or unusual fatigue may indicate a serious\nproblem. If you have any of these, contact your health care\nprovider.\n\nAdditional Details:\nCanadian wildfire smoke will impact surface air quality as it\nmoves ENE across northern portions of the state later Monday\nmorning through early Tuesday afternoon. The heaviest smoke\nimpacts are expected in far northwest Wisconsin, where\nPM2.5 NowCast AQI values of Unhealthy (Red) will be possible.\nLesser impacts in the Moderate (Yellow) to Unhealthy for\nSensitive Groups (Orange) AQI range are expected further south\nand east in the advisory area. A cold front moving in from the\nnorthwest on Tuesday morning will begin to clear this initial\nround of smoke from northwest to southeast. Although more smoke\ncould move in behind the front, we do not expect advisory\ncriteria to be met with the second round of smoke at this time.\n\nFor more information on current air quality, please see:\nhttps://airquality.wi.gov",

                "description": "The Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources has issued an Air\nQuality Advisory for the following counties: Adams, Ashland,\nBarron, Bayfield, Brown, Buffalo, Burnett, Chippewa, Clark, Door,\nDouglas, Dunn, Eau Claire, Florence, Forest, Iron, Jackson,\nJuneau, Kewaunee, La Crosse, Langlade, Lincoln, Marathon,\nMarinette, Menominee, Monroe, Oconto, Oneida, Outagamie, Pepin,\nPierce, Polk, Portage, Price, Rusk, Sawyer, Shawano, St. Croix,\nTaylor, Trempealeau, Vernon, Vilas, Washburn, Waupaca, Waushara,\nWood.\n\nWHAT...The PM2.5 AQI is expected to reach the Unhealthy for\nSensitive Groups (Orange) to Unhealthy (Red) level.\n\nWHERE...Northern Wisconsin and west-central Wisconsin.\n\nWHEN...From 10 AM Monday until 3 PM Tuesday.\n\nPrecautionary/Preparedness Actions:\nSensitive groups: Make outdoor activities shorter and less\nintense. It is OK to be active outdoors but take more breaks.\nWatch for symptoms such as coughing or shortness of breath.\n\nPeople with asthma: Follow your asthma action plan and keep quick\nrelief medicine handy.\n\nPeople with heart disease: Symptoms such as palpitations,\nshortness of breath, or unusual fatigue may indicate a serious\nproblem. If you have any of these, contact your health care\nprovider.\n\nAdditional Details:\nCanadian wildfire smoke will impact surface air quality as it\nmoves ENE across northern portions of the state later Monday\nmorning through early Tuesday afternoon. The heaviest smoke\nimpacts are expected in far northwest Wisconsin, where\nPM2.5 NowCast AQI values of Unhealthy (Red) will be possible.\nLesser impacts in the Moderate (Yellow) to Unhealthy for\nSensitive Groups (Orange) AQI range are expected further south\nand east in the advisory area. A cold front moving in from the\nnorthwest on Tuesday morning will begin to clear this initial\nround of smoke from northwest to southeast. Although more smoke\ncould move in behind the front, we do not expect advisory\ncriteria to be met with the second round of smoke at this time.\n\nFor more information on current air quality, please see:\nhttps://airquality.wi.gov",

The Air Quality Index, or AQI, was created as an easy way to\ncorrelate levels of different pollutants to one scale. The higher\nthe AQI value, the greater the health concern.\n\nWhen pollution levels are elevated, the New York State Department of\nHealth recommends that individuals consider limiting strenuous\noutdoor physical activity to reduce the risk of adverse health\neffects. People who may be especially sensitive to the effects of\nelevated levels of pollutants include the very young, and those with\npreexisting respiratory problems such as asthma or heart disease.\nThose with symptoms should consider consulting their personal\nphysician.\n\nFor additional information, please visit the New York State\nDepartment of Environmental Conservation website at,\nhttps://on.ny.gov/nyaqi, or call the Air Quality Hotline at\n1 800 5 3 5, 1 3 4 5.",

Extensive\nstreet flooding and flooding of creeks and rivers are possible.\n\n* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...\n- Additional bands of showers and thunderstorms will impact the\ncoast of Southeast South Carolina and Southeast Georgia\ntoday. Much of this area has observed significant rainfall\nover the past several days. With saturated soil conditions in\nplace, it will not take too much additional heavy rainfall to\nproduce urban flooding and flash flooding, especially in the\nmore urbanized areas around Charleston, Beaufort, Savannah\nand Hinesville.

People who may be especially sensitive to the effects of\nelevated levels of pollutants include the very young, and those with\npreexisting respiratory problems such as asthma or heart disease.\nThose with symptoms should consider consulting their personal\nphysician.\n\nFor additional information, please visit the New York State\nDepartment of Environmental Conservation website at,\nhttps://on.ny.gov/nyaqi, or call the Air Quality Hotline at\n1 800 5 3 5, 1 3 4 5.",

                "description": "The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation at\nAlbany has issued a Air Quality Health Advisory for Ground Level\nOzone from 11 AM this morning to 11 PM EDT this evening.\n\nAir quality levels in outdoor air are predicted to be greater than\nan air quality index value of 100 for Ground Level Ozone. The air\nquality index...or AQI...was created as an easy way to correlate\nlevels of different pollutants to one scale. The higher the AQI\nvalue, the greater the health concern.\n\nWhen pollution levels are elevated...the New York State Department\nof Health recommends that individuals consider limiting strenuous\noutdoor physical activity to reduce the risk of adverse health\neffects. People who may be especially sensitive to the effects of\nelevated levels of pollutants include the very young and those with\npre existing respiratory problems such as asthma or heart disease.\nThose with symptoms should consider consulting their personal\nphysician.\n\nFor additional information, please visit the New York State\nDepartment of Environmental Conservation website at,\nhttps://on.ny.gov/nyaqi, or call the Air Quality Hotline at\n800-535-1345.",

Extensive\nstreet flooding and flooding of creeks and rivers are possible.\n\n* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...\n- Additional bands of showers and thunderstorms will impact the\ncoast of Southeast South Carolina and Southeast Georgia\ntoday. Much of this area has observed significant rainfall\nover the past several days. With saturated soil conditions in\nplace, it will not take too much additional heavy rainfall to\nproduce urban flooding and flash flooding, especially in the\nmore urbanized areas around Charleston, Beaufort, Savannah\nand Hinesville.
